	<p id="fruit_description">n botany, a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific 
				 			  tissues of the flower, one or more ovaries, and in some cases accessory tissues. 
				 			  Fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds. Many of them that 
				 			  bear edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans 
				 			  and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition,
				 			  respectively; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.</p>
	<p id="vegetable_description">The non-biological definition of a vegetable is largely based on culinary and cultural tradition. 
								   Apart from vegetables, other main types of plant food are fruits, grains and nuts. Vegetables are most 
								   often consumed as salads or cooked in savory or salty dishes, while culinary fruits are usually 
								   sweet and used for desserts, but it is not the universal rule.</p>	
	 <p id="bean_description">The term bean originally referred to the seed of the broad or fava bean, but was later expanded to include 
	 						  members of the New World genus Phaseolus, such as the common bean and the runner bean, and the related genus 
	 						  Vigna. The term is now applied generally to many other related plants such as Old World soybeans, peas, chickpeas 
	 						  (garbanzos), vetches, and lupins.</p>
